				<p> <i><b>My App idea from Project 1</i></b> <br>

					My idea from Project one was to create a new app, the app is used on mobiles and is for people to use exclusively for sending out voice recorded messages to people on all social media platforms chosen. The app allows you to connect your Facebook, instagram, email, and phone text message, to the app and use it to send a quick message through voice analysis. After connecting the app with all your socials you are able to voice record a message and then chose with what app and who you want to send the message to. Wifi or 3g will need to be enables in order for V.A.P.E to be able to message individuals on internet platforms.

					<br> <br> <br>

					<i><b> Direction for the app</b></i> <br> 

					V.A.P.A is designed to insure users have an option that is more efficient and easy for when it comes to messaging others. Voice recording yourself to either send a recorded or typed out a message is much quicker, which can be beneficial when you’re on the go but need to contact someone by message in that point in time. It’s designed to do the work for you as the app goes to whatever platform you need and records for you while you’re able to continue what you may be doing instead of stopping everything you may be doing to type out a whole message to someone. V.A.P.A is useful for anyone as it can be used due to being too busy to simply send a message or just for everyday use as it is straightforward and easy to use.

				<p> <b><i> Beginning: </b></i> <br> 
					Using the material from my first project I gathered my logo designs and app icon. I began by doing some rough Wireframes in sigma on a iPhone template to get an idea of what it may look like. I decided to keep my wireframes for my prototypes clean and elementary for an effortless user experience.

				<p> <b><i> </b></i> <br>
					After making rough Wireframes, I started developing prototypes in photoshop. My prototypes are very much similar to my wireframe but with more detail and colour. I kept the same colour palette as project one for my prototype app, as well as the aesthetic of being simple and elegant. 

					I have included a landing page, register page, connect with phone, and connect with social media apps. I then included the pages of the three apps as well as the page where you record a message.

				<p> <b><i> Process </b></i> <br>

					After making rough prototypes then finalising them on photoshop, I then took those design’s and brought them into Adobe XD to make linked prototypes that users can see how the app would work. In Adobe XD I placed every page on ‘iPhone X/XS’ size pages to give a rational view of how a realistic finalised app would look like if a real person was to use it.

					The final outcome of my prototype shows my minimalistic app idea and how the user experience would be. The steps included in the app are straight forward and easy to use for anyone, it allows a user to connect with a few different applications where they can send a recorded message too. I chose to show Facebook as an example of how it would look when a message is recorded and ready to send in the last prototype frame. The frame shows an easy process where the app takes you to Facebook and allows you to chose someone from your friends list to send the message to.
